# Bragazzi’s

Bragazzi’s is a traditional Italian cafe, delicatessen and shop. It’s deeply set in its community and has a very particular feel and atmosphere. It needed a marketing website to root their online presence and show their personality, with a heavy emphasis on SEO optimisation.

#### Technologies

- SASS
- framer-motion

I wanted to get the most out of the beautiful photography we had available. The client wanted to update business information based on Google Business Data so the he could keep using the interface he was familiar with. There also needed to be the opportunity to add shop functionality in the future. Gatsby’s image components and huge plugin library for API calls making data available through graphql page queries, coupled with (as of 3.0) the Shopify plugin as an option in the future, made Gatsby a great choice for this project.

## Status

Complete. With potential to add shop functionality in the future.

## Reflection

The main challenge with this project was working to client specifications. Since tone and company brand were so important, being able to translate what the client wanted into both the design and functionality taught me a lot about the development process.

Testing for visual bugs on multiple devices is much more important with commissioned work and I learned to create more detailed, robust, responsive CSS / SASS.
